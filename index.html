											It’s up to you and your team whether or not you want to spend your full 24 hours perfecting
											your performance or spend the night sprawled out with a sleeping bag on the theatre floor.
											All we ask is that all ideation of the plays be done on-site.
											<br>
											<br>
											<span class="howItWorksBold">REGISTRATION:</span> Registration ends on <span class="lightBold">September 8th at 11:59pm.</span>

											in the <i>Group</i> section in the eventbrite registration page <i>(Note: each team member must buy
												a ticket)</i>. If you don’t have a team when signing up, not to worry! Registered individuals will be added to a
												Facebook group where you’ll get the chance to meet other participants, chat, and form your own teams.
												<span class="lightBold">P4C reserves the right to modify teams accordingly to ensure that all participants are placed in a
													team by September 15th at 11:59pm.</span>
													<br>
													<br>
													<span class="howItWorksBold">MENTORS & ASSIGNED TOPICS:</span> During the first day of the event, each team will be randomly assigned 1 of 6
													topics (listed above) which their play should explore and be centred around. Each team will be paired with a <span class="lightBold">Topic Mentor</span> from
													the Vancouver community who is knowledgeable and actively involved in the respective field. They will guide you during the first night of the
													competition to develop a more nuanced understanding of the topic. On the second day, each team will be assigned a theatre element which they must
													integrate into their play. Each team will be paired with a respective <span class="lightBold">Surprise Element Mentor</span> who will work with them for 1 hour to perfect
													their element and its integration.
													<br>
													<br>
													<span class="howItWorksBold">RULES:</span> The final play can be <span class="lightBold">a maximum of 15 minutes</span> in length and must be centred
													around the team’s given topic. <span class="lightBold">Final scripts are due at 4pm on Sunday September 26th. </span> Only P4C props, theatre elements, and sound effects may be used,
													however each team will have access to their <span class="lightBold">Topic Mentor</span> for the first night, their <span class="lightBold">Surprise
														Element Mentor</span> for 1 hour on the second day, and internet for the entire event. It is highly recommended that participants bring their own devices, such
														as laptops. Overall, teams are given full creative control for their piece. A detailed judging rubric will be released on September 25th.
														<br>
														<br>
														<span class="howItWorksBold">FOOD & SLEEP:</span> priority #1 and #2! Included in your ticket are meals for both days (1 dinner, 1 breakfast, 1 lunch)

													<br>
													<h4 class= "paragraphMod"><span class="howItWorksBold">POWER UP & POWER DOWN:</span> Beware. Similar to the barriers organizations face when proposing
														real policy, teams will be able to “power up” or “power down” themselves or other teams <i>for a price</i>. Each
														team will be <i>given $30 in FREE tokens at the start of the event</i>, and may purchase more tokens onsite <span class="lightBold">(prices range from $5- $15,
															cash or e-transfer accepted)</span>.
															<br>
															<br>
															<span class="howItWorksBold">THEATRE ELEMENTS:</span> On the second day of the event, each team will be randomly given a theatre
															element which they must integrate into their play. There are <span class="lightBold">3 different Surprise Elements: Acapella, Dance Routine, or Mask</span>.
															<i>Rumour has it that a certain Power Up will allow you to switch your theatre element with a team of your choice.</i>
															<br>
															<br>
															<span class="howItWorksBold">PROPS:</span> On the second day teams will be given access to props. A list will be provided before The Prop Room is
															unlocked however make sure you proceed with caution, <span class="lightBold">props are first come, first serve.... and there will be blood.</span>
															<br>
